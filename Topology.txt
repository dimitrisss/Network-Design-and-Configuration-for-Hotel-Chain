

Network Topology:
1. Hotel Layout:
Hotel 1 (H1)
Hotel 2 (H2)
Hotel 3 (H3)
Hotel 4 (H4)
Hotel 5 (H5)
2. Subnets:
Each hotel should have its own subnet.
H1 Subnet: 192.168.1.0/24 
H2 Subnet: 192.168.2.0/24
H3 Subnet: 192.168.3.0/24
H4 Subnet: 192.168.4.0/24
H5 Subnet: 192.168.5.0/24
3. Gateway:
Each hotel should have a dedicated gateway router.
H1 Gateway: 192.168.1.1
H2 Gateway: 192.168.2.1
H3 Gateway: 192.168.3.1
H4 Gateway: 192.168.4.1
H5 Gateway: 192.168.5.1

4. Interconnecting Hotels:
Use a central data center or a dedicated connection to interconnect hotels.
Assign a separate subnet for interconnecting the hotels.
Interconnecting Subnet: 10.0.0.0/24


Explanation:
Each router has two serial interfaces, one connecting to the previous router and one connecting to the next router.
The subnet used for each point-to-point link is /29, providing six usable IP addresses.
Adjust OSPF configuration on each router to enable routing between them.

IP Addresses Assignment:
Router 1 - Serial0/0/0: 192.168.100.1/29
Router 2 - Serial0/0/0: 192.168.100.2/29, 
Router 3 - Serial0/0/0: 192.168.100.3/29, 
Router 4 - Serial0/0/0: 192.168.100.4/29, 
Router 5 - Serial0/0/0: 192.168.100.5/29

Important Considerations and Decisions:
IP Addressing Scheme:

Private IP addresses from the RFC 1918 range (192.168.x.x) are used, ensuring that the internal network addresses are unique and won't conflict with public IP addresses.

VLAN Design:
VLANs are used to logically segment the network. Each VLAN corresponds to a specific function (Guest, Staff, Rooms, Extra, and Management). This segmentation enhances security, isolates broadcast domains, and facilitates network management.

Unique VLAN IDs:
Each VLAN within a hotel has a unique VLAN ID to avoid any confusion or conflicts. VLAN IDs help in organizing and categorizing network traffic.

Management VLAN:
A dedicated VLAN (VLAN 99) is allocated for management purposes in each hotel. This VLAN can be used for network management, monitoring, and devices requiring special access.

IP Subnetting:
Each VLAN has its own subnet, ensuring that devices within a VLAN can communicate with each other while maintaining separation from devices in other VLANs. Subnetting also helps in efficient IP address utilization.

Consistency Across Hotels:
The addressing scheme is consistent across all hotels, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot the network. Consistency simplifies documentation and facilitates understanding for network administrators.

Future Expansion:
An "Extra" VLAN is included in each hotel's design (VLAN 40), providing flexibility for future expansion or for accommodating devices with specific requirements. This allows for scalability as the network grows.

Clear Addressing Details:
The addressing details table provides clear information about each VLAN, including the subnet, IP range, usable IP range, and broadcast address. This table helps network administrators understand the allocation of IP addresses within each VLAN.

Documentation:
Proper documentation is essential for network management. Including an addressing details table in the documentation helps in maintaining and troubleshooting the network in the future.

Security and Isolation:
VLAN segmentation enhances security by isolating different types of network traffic. For example, guest devices are in a separate VLAN from staff and management devices, reducing the attack surface and potential security risks.
